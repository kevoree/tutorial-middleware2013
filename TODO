practise -> practice
dynamically updates -> updates at runtime
Why software are ...  -> Why is software distributed ...
geographically adapted -> geographic adaptation
physically adapted -> physical adaptation
network error ... -> network failures break retrieve/update exchanges
when will C be updated : je ne comprends pas trop
Research questions ? - > Research questions
manipulate distributed -> manage distributed
-- no space before the question mark, or before colon (:)
issue in several distributed environment -> issue in distributed environments

opportunistic nodes A, B, C - > N1, N2 ...
[Architectural abstraction needed] legend -> key
Kevoree Project -> The Kevoree Project
A model as abstraction -> A model as an abstraction
Encapsulate -> Encapsulates
[Channel Type] Implement -> Implements
-- Outline/relief fonts are very difficult to read!!!
Let's try -> Let's try it


the last Kevoree editor - > the latest Kevoree editor
bound through an Distributed Broadcast -> bound through a Distributed Broadcast
servcie -> service
Input binding use -> Input bindings use
Kevoree Modelling -> Kevoree Modeling
remvoe -> remove
Kevoree for managing cloud -> Kevoree for cloud management
Kevoree node is a container, of -> Kevoree node is a container of
parent node has responsibility for -> is responsible for
NodeType refine -> NodeType refines
Think the Cloud -> See the Cloud
Just Add/Remove ...  -> Add/Remove node capability only
that dynamically reallocate -> that dynamically reallocates
[Challenges of adaptation ... ] -- lines appear at once, not one after the other
not powered enough -> not powerful enough
[For comfort ans critical uses] -- unclear
FIFO on font of each ports -> ????
If you get lost -> If you got lost
